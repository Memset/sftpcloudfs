2014-10-06 Juan Martinez <juan@memset.com>

 * release 0.15:

  - Added "insecure" configuration token to support connections to auth
  servers with invalid SSL certificates.

This release requies ftpcloudfs >= 0.30 and uses swiftclient >= 2.0.0 (and
requests library). Please test thoroughly before upgrading your production
systems.

2014-05-15 Juan Martinez <juan@memset.com>

 * release 0.14.1:

  - Explicitly close connections. In some conditions Python garbage
  collector may not close all the opened connections. This is really uncommon,
  but users are encouraged to upgrade.

2014-04-17 Juan Martinez <juan@memset.com>

 * release 0.14:

  - New configuration token 'auth-timeout' to make auth time limit
    configurable (defaults to 60 seconds).
  - Added optional SSH negotiation time limit, exposed via 'negotiation-timeout'
    configuration token.
  - Clarification in sftpcloudfs.conf.example (re: quotes in string tokens).

  New timeout configuration can improve server's behaviour vs SSH brute-force
  attacks.

 * release 0.12.1, 0.12.2:

  - ftp-cloudfs version bumped to 0.25.2.

  0.25.2 fixes an information leak vulnerability in sftp-cloudfs when the
  shared cache (memcache) is used. Under certain conditions the SFTP server
  could serve the cached directory listing of a different user.
  
  Upgrading ftp-cloudfs is highly recommended.
